When a Gamertag comes up as violating our policies for online behavior, 
the person who owns that Gamertag is punished by being banned from the 
service. Keep in mind, this is not just a ban on a particular game. This
is a ban on the Xbox Live service as a whole, so you will not be able to 
go online at all during your ban
